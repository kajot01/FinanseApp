# FinanseApp

## Introduction

This is an app which is an interface for excel sheet containing all of my incomes and expenses. That SH has some graphs and summaries beside pure data which are focus of this project.

The target of this app is to extend usage of my finance recording. By extending i mean giving better user expirience by giving possibility to use SH without opening Excel. Thereby user should have option to access Excel and write data. The last requirement is made for use on phone.  TO mak this app available for phone to i shoul built real app. And my path to achive this goal isn't that.
